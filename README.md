# Cycling Workout

This is an application which uses the [Web Bluetooth
API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API) to
connect to power meters and cycling trainers to run cycling workouts.

You can use it at [cycling.xymoste.ch](https://cycling.xymoste.ch/).

It shows current power and a graph of historical power, and supports setting
target power on devices that support it (like electronic trainers).

Note: Because the Web Bluetooth API [only works on Chrome-based
browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Bluetooth_API#browser_compatibility)
(for now), this app will only work in Chrome.
